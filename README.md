<h1> Jonatha's Portfolio </h1>
<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p> My project is about a website on portfolio so that employers or even other people can look through the information of this person or to look up at projects that the person have included in his/her website. Having a portfolio website is a good way to impress employers as they know you have knowledge of HTML which might be beneficial to the company. </p>

<p>The website is about a portfolio of Johnathan Tan who is preparing for his internship. The website consist of Johnathan's background, his portfolio and a place to contact Johnathan for enquiries. </p>

<h4>Design process</h4>
<p>The design of the website is just simple and clean as I do not want to create to many destractions and want it to be straight forward for people who are viewing the portfolio. Therefore most parts of the website is dark in colour which will highlight the text and the images.</p>

<p> As an Employer, I would want to view resume to understand the person better. <p>
<p> As an Employer, I would want to contact so that if I like this person, I would like to contact him/her to do an interview with me.</p>
<p> As an Employer, I would want to view the works so that I can see that if the works that this person have done is beneficial to the company.
